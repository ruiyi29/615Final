EDA and Shiny Apps for MBTA.  
I did the analysis for stops on the Orange Line and made some plots to show the distribution of the travel time. 
For the shiny part, I made two Shiny Apps. For the brief one, I included three pairs of stops for the T part. Similar methods can be applied to other categories of MBTA. For the complicated one, I tried to make the map to show only the two selected stops. I made many attempts but none of them succeeded. 
I have figured out the part I need to change but have not found out how to change it.
